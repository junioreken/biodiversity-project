# National Parks Biodiversity Data Analysis
* Project that consisted in analyzing the data and conservation statuses of endangered species from different parks.
* Determined which species were more likely to be endangered and number of occurrences of different species using hypothesis and significance tests. 
* Performed tasks such as data manipulation, data cleaning, and posing questions using Pandas, Matplotlib and SciPy. Derived meaningful answers to my questions using Hypothesis testing and presented findings via bar charts. 
* Performed the chi-squared significance tests on contingency tables to see if findings like the fact that mammals were more likely to be endangered than birds was actually significant. The difference was not significant. Performed a chi-squared test because the data was numerical and 2 datasets were compared.
